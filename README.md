This is a beginner-friendly Flask project where I built a **personal name card website**. The purpose of this project was to understand the basics of **web development using Flask**, including:

* ✅ How to set up a Flask project
* ✅ How to render HTML files using `render_template()`

### 🔧 Project Details

The website shows:

* My name and profession
* A profile picture
* Social media links (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook)

All the styling and design are handled by static CSS files, and the layout is mobile-friendly thanks to the template used from [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net).
